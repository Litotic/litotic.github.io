    <h1>Year Advancement, Graduation</h1>
    <p>First through third years enjoy the finest quality arcane education on NRC's founding 
        Sage Isle campus.<br>
        Third years will spent their spring semester preparing to embark on study abroad internships
        or domestic apprenticeships in their fourth year fall.<br>
        In fourth year spring, the pre-graduates are back on campus to present their final projects,
        reflect on their learning, and pass down mentorship to underclassmen.
        <br>After graduation, NRC is proud to boast a strong and steadfast network of alumni 
        supporting alumni, and often invites them back to its hallowed halls <br>as guest lecturers
        or recruiters. <br>
   
     </p>

     <h1>Visitors and Mailing</h1>
    <p>Although NRC is typically closed to outside visitors in order to respect the focus
        of its students' education, <br>exceptions are often made for alumni with educational 
        assistance purposes. For family and friends, please limit yourselves to sending letters
        and packages <br>to express your feelings outside of family emergencies or designated
        opening days, such as the Halloween Festival or the Spring Fair.<br>
        For your convenience, our mailing address is below.
