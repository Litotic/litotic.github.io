    <!--Explanation for theme: This is a hypothetical school site for a fictional
'arcane academy' or 'magic college', Night Raven College, which exists in a game I enjoy.
I wanted the challenge of bringing to life a slice of a world that does not actually
exist, but imagining how it could in a world similar to ours. You can also just treat 
it as a school site for a fictional school I made up, although I will be referencing
some game information for some things as much as I easily can (i.e. class content, 
location, etc.) The location I'll put for the iframe on page 4 will be for the company
that develops this game. 

I will include in the page content for this theme:
* a hypothetical class schedule (page 2)
* school club culture and a list of clubs you can join (page 2)
* explanation of the themed dorms you can live in with a housing and 
mailing list registration mockup (page 3)
* how the year system works (page 3)
* and more! (page 4)
It will all be some fun and useful information for a fictional (mage) visitor trying to decide
if this is the college for them.
